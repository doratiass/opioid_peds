# **Sustained opioid use in children and adolescent**

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my thesis project, focused on understanding sustained opioid use in pediatric populations in Israel through the analysis of the Clalit healthcare services database.

## **Project Overview**

This research is structured into two key components:

1.  Descriptive Part:

    1.  Epidemiological Study Explore opioid use patterns among children and adolescents.

    2.  Identify risk factors contributing to sustained opioid use.

2.  Predictive Part: Machine Learning-Based Risk Calculator

    1.  Develop a predictive model to calculate the risk of sustained opioid use.

## **Code Repository**

The entire codebase for this study is accessible in the main branch under the **`/scripts/descriptive`** and **`/scripts/predictive`** directories. Due to privacy considerations, the dataset used for this research cannot be shared.

## **Online Calculator**

To enhance accessibility and understanding, an online risk calculator with SHAP (Shapley additive explanations) values has been implemented. You can interact with the calculator [here](https://dorati-opioid-use-peds.hf.space/).

Feel free to explore the results and engage with this interactive tool. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for your interest in this research project!
